# Using-Random-Forest-and-SVM-finding-accuracy-for-the-dataset

Hear we have taken a dataset, and for that dataset we have used 2 algorithm to find the best accuracy using Python in googlecolab. 
The Random Forest algorithm gives best accuracy then the SVM so we declare that random forest algorithm is best for bigger projects.
